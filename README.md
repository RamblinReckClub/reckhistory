# reckhistory
A history site for the Ramblin' Reck.

## Setup

* Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (if you don't have it preinstalled on your machine), [RubyGems](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/) (which should install with Ruby) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* Clone this repo, open a Terminal window (if you didn't clone via `git`) and `cd` into the root directory (IE: `cd reckhistory`).
* Run `jekyll serve` in a Terminal window. Take note of the URL generated by Jekyll.
* Open a browser window and navigate to the address from the last step (should be http://localhost:<port>/reckhistory or something along those lines).

Any changes you make to project files will be picked up live when you refresh the browser. If you change a file in any file or folder starting with an underscore (`_includes`,`_layouts`, etc.), then you will need to restart the Jekyll server (IE: close the Terminal window that has that running OR do a Ctrl+C, then run `jekyll serve` again).
