    - title: Field's Model T rambles across campus
      description: Dean of Men Floyd Field owned a Ford Model T that he frequently drove around campus. Eventually, the car became an icon on campus, often referred to as a "Ramblin' Wreck".
      location: 1916-1928 (Atlanta, GA)
    - title: Field gives the Wreck an overhaul
      description: With the help of the machine shop on campus, Dean Field gives his Model T a massive overhaul. As described by the Technique, "Gone are the wheezes and grunts. New fenders on the rear have restored her shapely form and hidden her spindly axles. A new top has given the needed touch of seasoned smart- ness and an enveloping coat of paint has been imposed upon her lovely tin body. Thus we have with us yet "our own original Ramblin' Wreck" locking daintier, and, as the dean himself puts it, "Better than ever."
      location: 1926 (Atlanta, GA)
